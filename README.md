# CollegeFootball2015
This is originally created by joebluems. I reimplemented the same algorithm using Python to show that the rudimentary matrix operations can be done with numpy and scipy. 

Run the page rank algorithm based on 2015 football scores to evaluate the selection committee's rankings
Note: the scores were downloaded from here: http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2015-schedule.html

If you just want to generate the rankings...<br>
  1. download octave (or Matlab if you have it) - https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html <br>
  2. execute at linux prompt: <b> linux> octave page.m </b><br>
  Output should look like this:<br>
  Clemson<br>
  Michigan State<br>
  Alabama<br>
  Stanford<br>
  Oklahoma<br>
  Houston<br>
  Iowa<br>
  Ohio State<br>
  ...

If you want to build the matrix from the scores or try it with data from a different season, do these additional steps...<br>
  1. download csv from a suitable website (such as http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2015-schedule.html)<br>
  2. run the football.py script with no arguments to generate the H matrix from stdout<br>
    <b> linux> ./football.py > H.mat </b>
  3. run the football.py script a second time with an argument to generate the file teams.csv<br>
    <b> linux> ./football.py 1 > teams.csv </b>
  4. run the page ranks in octave as above
    <b> linux> octave page.m </b><br>
